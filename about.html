                <p>Gonzalo "ZeRo" Barrios is an eSports competitive Super Smash Bros. player. Originally born and raised in Chile with a poor childhood full of bullying, Barrios set out and moved to America to compete in Smash Bros. Brawl tournaments just to "give it a shot". He became a major threat, and ranked 3rd in the world at the end of Brawl's lifespan in 2014. When Super Smash Bros. for the Wii U, otherwise known as Smash 4, came out that same year, ZeRo went on a tear, as in winning 56 tournaments in a row and being the undisputed best player in the world. Even after his streak was broken, he kept his #1 spot in the rankings for his entire Smash 4 career. At the start of 2018, he retired, and will be coming back for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate coming out this December.
